## ❤️ Personal Note

This project is a part of my journey to learn programming practically.  
I started by applying the ideas step by step, and over time I began improving and refactoring the code through practice — and with the help of ChatGPT 🙌  
Each file here reflects a stage in my growth and understanding.

Every project I build brings me one step closer to becoming a professional...  
But the most important thing is: **consistency** 💡

As part of this course, I'm also learning how to:

- Define business requirements  
- Understand and apply business logic  
- Create clear planning  
- Execute with focus  
- Test for better outcomes
